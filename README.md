# odin-etch-a-sketch




Initial commit for the Odin projects etch-a-sketch project.

While this may be wildly inappropriate, I would just like to give a HUGE shoutout
to Daniel Shiffman https://shiffman.net/ and the p5js organization https://p5js.org/
as well as the processing foundation https://processing.org/ ! With out the 3
of them I would have been struggling to get my head around a 2 dimensional grid.
And last but not least to all the people behind the scenes at The Coding Train,
https://thecodingtrain.com/ and the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 3 or so years
ago all y'all changed the way I looked at code.
